        <p>Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element.The most common attributes include the id attribute, 
        which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable 
        content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.

        Attributes are defined within the opening tag, after an element’s name. Generally attributes include a name and a value. The format
        for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an equals sign and then a quoted attribute value. For example, 
        an <a> element including an href attribute would look like the following:</p>
        
        <p>HTML documents are plain text documents saved with an .html file extension rather than a .txt file extension. To begin writing HTML, 
        you first need a plain text editor that you are comfortable using. Sadly this does not include Microsoft Word or Pages, as those are
        rich text editors. Two of the more popular plain text editors for writing HTML and CSS are Dreamweaver and Sublime Text. 
        Free alternatives also include Notepad++ for Windows and TextWrangler for Mac.

        All HTML documents have a required structure that includes the following declaration and elements: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, 
        and <body>.The document type declaration, or <!DOCTYPE html>, informs web browsers which version of HTML is being used and is placed
        at the very beginning of the HTML document. Because we’ll be using the latest version of HTML, our document type declaration is simply
        <!DOCTYPE html>. Following the document type declaration, the <html> element signifies the beginning of the document.
            
        Inside the <html> element, the <head> element identifies the top of the document, including any metadata (accompanying information about 
        the page). The content inside the <head> element is not displayed on the web page itself. Instead, it may include the document title 
        (which is displayed on the title bar in the browser window), links to any external files, or any other beneficial metadata. 
        All of the visible content within the web page will fall within the <body> element.

        <h3><b> Getting to Know CSS</b> </h3>
        <p> CSS is a complex language that packs quite a bit of power. It allows us to add layout and design to our pages, and it allows us to 
            share those styles from element to element and page to page. Before we can unlock all of its features, though, there are a few aspects 
            of the language we must fully understand.
            First, it’s crucial to know exactly how styles are rendered. Specifically, we’ll need to know how different types of selectors work 
            and how the order of those selectors can affect how our styles are rendered. We’ll also want to understand a few common property 
            values that continually appear within CSS, particularly those that deal with color and length.
            Let’s look under the hood of CSS to see exactly what is going on.
        </p>
            <p>We’ll begin breaking down exactly how styles are rendered by looking at what is known as the cascade and studying a few examples of
                 the cascade in action. Within CSS, all styles cascade from the top of a style sheet to the bottom, allowing different styles to 
                 be added or overwritten as the style sheet progresses.

                For example, say we select all paragraph elements at the top of our style sheet and set their background color to orange and 
                their font size to 24 pixels. Then towards the bottom of our style sheet, we select all paragraph elements again and set their 
                background color to green, as seen here.
            </p>

        <h3> Calculating Specificity</h3>
        <p>Every selector in CSS has a specificity weight. A selector’s specificity weight, along with its placement in the cascade, identifies 
            how its styles will be rendered. In Lesson 1, “Building Your First Web Page,” we talked about three different types of selectors: 
            the type, class, and ID selectors. Each of these selectors has a different specificity weight. The type selector has the lowest
            specificity weight and holds a point value of 0-0-1. The class selector has a medium specificity weight and holds a point value of 
            0-1-0. Lastly, the ID selector has a high specificity weight and holds a point value of 1-0-0. As we can see, specificity points are 
            calculated using three columns. The first column counts ID selectors, the second column counts class selectors, and the third column
            counts type selectors. What’s important to note here is that the ID selector has a higher specificity weight than the class selector, 
            and the class selector has a higher specificity weight than the type selector. The specificity weights of different types of selectors 
            are incredibly important to remember. At times styles may not appear on elements as intended, and chances are the specificity weights 
            of our selectors are breaking the cascade, therefore our styles are not appearing properly.
        </p>

        <h3><b> Combining Selectors</b></h3>
        <p>
            When selectors are combined they should be read from right to left. The selector farthest to the right, directly before the opening 
            curly bracket, is known as the key selector. The key selector identifies exactly which element the styles will be applied to. Any 
            selector to the left of the key selector will serve as a prequalifier. The first combined selector above, .hotdog p, includes two 
            selectors: a class and a type selector. These two selectors are separated by a single space. The key selector is a type selector 
            targeting paragraph elements. And because this type selector is prequalified with a class selector of hotdog, the full combined 
            selector will only select paragraph elements that reside within an element with a class attribute value of hotdog. The second selector 
            e, .hotdog p.mustard, includes three selectors: two class selectors and one type selector. The only difference between the second selector 
            and the first selector is the addition of the class selector of mustard to the end of the paragraph type selector. Because the new class 
            selector, mustard, falls all the way to the right of the combined selector, it is the key selector, and all of the individual selectors 
            coming before it are now prequalifiers.
